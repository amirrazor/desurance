# Decentralized insurance - Fullstack

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how a decentralized insurance could be possible using Ethereum's testnets and smart contracts. The platform is designed to provide many advantages over traditional centralized fundraising platforms, thanks to its decentralized nature. <p>  The demo of the platform can be accessed at "https://desurance.de" </p>

### Current testnet: Goerli
The smart contract is deployed on the Goerli test network and uses test money only. Nobody profits from this project. <p> Feel free to get started with the projects and if you have any questions or feedbacks, please let me know! </p>
