# The Desurance project: decentralized insurance using blockchains and smart contracts

This project demonstrates how a decentralized insurance could be possible using Ethereum's testnets and smart contracts.

Current testnet: Goerli
The smart contract is deployed on the Goerli test network.


Note: The Rinkeby test network will soon be shut down due to Ethereum's transition from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake. In that case the Goerly test network may be used.

Further tools used in the project: Hardhat, ethersjs...
